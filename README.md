# Know Your Lover

A fun game to get to know your significant other a bit better.

The initial iteration required both individuals to share the same device (and was gender binary). This second iteration allows for displaced individuals to play together dispite their distance (granted they can communicate with each other).

## How to Play

Create a session for you and your boo, so the two of you can play together. You'll each be asked the same question, and you'll answer individually at the same time. You can guess each other's answers or move on to the next question.

Once all the questions have finished, you'll be able to review the questions and see how well you know each other.
